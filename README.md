### 🚧 What is happening here?

We are working on transitioning YTManager from a Command Line Interface (CLI) to a full modern **GUI**.
The goal is to make the application accessible to everyone, eliminating the need to use the terminal while keeping the same powerful features of the original version.

### Current Status

* [x] Project Structure Setup
* [ ] Main Menu UI Design
* [ ] Playlist Manager Integration
* [ ] Settings & Configuration UI
* [ ] Real-time Download Progress Bars

### 🔙 Looking for the stable version?

If you just want to download videos and playlists right now, please use the **Stable CLI Version**.
